            <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I've always lived up north, and in smaller towns. I was born in the upper peninsula of Michigan, AKA "Da
                UP",
                and my family and I moved to a tiny town in North Dakota called Ellendale ( Population: 1,200 during the
                school year) when I was 5 years old.. Lived there all the way through school excepting a small stint in
                an even small town in
                South
                Dakota called Warner which sits at about 480 people currently. It was in Ellendale in 6th grade when I
                met
                my wife, we started dating the summer before our senior year. Although that was when her and her family
                left
                for the east coast. We were long distance for about 3 1/2 years before we both ended up in Helena, MT.
                She
                moved here to live with her grandma, and I moved here to be with her. We got married June 15th, 2018 and
                we're expecting our first child in February of 2021.</p>

                        played Defensive End and lead my team in sacks and forced fumbles during my freshman year.
                        Unfortunately I couldn't really afford to stay in school for what I was going to school for. I
                        love, and miss the game.</p>
