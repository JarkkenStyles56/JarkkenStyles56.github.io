## This is where it all starts.

* These files are here to lay the foundations of not only a good webpage, but a good portfolio. One that looks good, and works well on multiple devices and screen sizes. It's meant to look organized and professional, with all of the staples of a good, working webpage. Links that work, pictures with words that fit neatly around the image, different headers to organize the content. All of this while showing that I have the ability to use clean, simple, and organized HTML elements, css styles, and bootstraps built in jss components.

* I hope to do this by incorporating everything we've learned thus far about using semantic HTML, incorporating bootstrap to avoid the copious amounts of necessary css and jss to make a webpage accessible and workable, and making a wire frame to guide me in my creative process. 

*Everything should be visually neat and readable on any device. Components should wrap when breakpoints are reached. Pictures, text, and other elements should have good spacing, (Margins, padding, etc.) in relation to the edges of the visible screen and also to one another.
